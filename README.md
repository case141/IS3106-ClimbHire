# ClimbHire
This is a digital commerce idea that we have created for our IS3106 Project in NUS. We have conceptualized is a simple toolkit which simplifies the process of recruitment and staff management, conveniently. We will be a truly great assistant because we empower both employers and employees to focus on what really matters to the success of their business. Our toolkit facilitates auto-matching of potential employees to direct employers based on their business requirements. We provide employees with the ability to track their working hours easily. Employees no longer need to go through the tedious procedure of manual recordings and still get paid accordingly. We also provide employers with integrated services to create schedules, timesheets and payrolls at ease.

## Business domain
ClimbHire is the one-stop solution for anyone from any industry who is looking to hire or get hired. We are focusing on Startups who are looking for a employee management system. That being said, we are open to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) using ClimbHire as well. For the context of this project, we are looking to deploy the application within Singapore (SG) only.
